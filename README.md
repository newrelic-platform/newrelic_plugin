# New Relic Platform Agent SDK

## Requirements

 * Tested with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.0
 
 Note: In Ruby 1.8.7 SSL is disabled by default due to issues with how Net::HTTP handles connection timeouts. 
If you override this the plugin may occasionally stop reporting data and require a restart.
To override you can add the following to `newrelic:` section of the newrelic_config.yml. 

```
